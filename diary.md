# Monday 
#### Time Spent: 60min

6:30 - conceived of idea:
Single Page Application 
Add and remove elements from the DOM as required.
Begin the page with a single note. 
Instructions and Overall Actions are in the Header Section. In the header, there is a button "Clear Wall" that will remove everything from the "main" section.





## Planning 

### Major Actions
On the DOM, there are note objects of class "note"
Main commands include:
* create a note
* type in the note 
* delete the note (Pressing red button)
* drag the note around 
* create duplicate notes 

### Minor Details 
* You can name the Header of Each Note 
* minimise the note
* There should be a text-bar flashing to show that you can type in this area
