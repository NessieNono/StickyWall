# Monday 
#### Time Spent: 60min

6:30 - conceived of idea:
Single Page Application 
Add and remove elements from the DOM as required.





## Planning 

### Major Actions
On the DOM, there are note objects of class "note"
Main commands include:
* create a note
* type in the note 
* delete the note
* drag the note around 
* create duplicate notes 

### Minor Details 
* You can name the Header of Each Note 
* minimise the note 





# Overall Lessons
------
To run your local server, you do these things in order: 

npm init : walks you through creating a package.json file
npm install: installs all dependencies listed in package.json
